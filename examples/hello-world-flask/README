# hello-world-flask

This simple Flask app that returns "Hello World".

## Prerequisites

You'll also need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed to run the example. Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment to run the example in so you don't need to manage one yourself.

## Running the example

Install the dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Run the application:

```bash
poetry run flask run
```

Now you can `curl` the app:

```bash
$ curl localhost:5000
Hello World
```
